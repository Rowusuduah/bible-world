# drift-guard

**Verify that pull requests do what they say.**

drift-guard is a git-native semantic PR intent verifier. You write what a PR is supposed to do — drift-guard checks whether the actual code changes fulfill it. Catches silent contract violations, scope creep, and incomplete implementations before they hit production.

```bash
pip install drift-guard
```

## The Problem

AI generates 42% of code in 2026. AI-assisted PRs create 1.7x more issues than human-only PRs. The core failure mode is **intent drift**: the PR says "fix null pointer in user registration" but the diff also silently removes an auth check. Tests pass. Code review misses it. Production breaks.

No existing tool verifies **whether a PR's code changes actually fulfill the stated intent**. Code review tools (CodeRabbit, PR-Agent) suggest improvements. Linters check syntax. CI runs tests. **Nobody checks: does this code do what the PR description says it will?**

drift-guard does exactly that.

---

## Quick Start

### CLI — verify a PR before merge

```bash
# From inside a git repo
drift-guard verify \
  --title "Fix null pointer in user registration when email is None" \
  --description "Adds None check before calling .lower() on email field in register_user(). Adds test for None email case." \
  --base origin/main \
  --head HEAD \
  --format text
```

**Output:**
```
drift-guard result: PASS
Drift score: 0.04 (threshold: 0.30)
Confidence: 92%

Intent summary:
  The PR claims to add a None check for the email field in user registration
  and add a corresponding test. The diff shows exactly this: a None guard
  added in register_user() and a new test_register_null_email() test function.

Clauses (2):
  [+] Adds None check before calling .lower() on email field
       -> Diff shows `if email is None: raise ValueError` added in register_user()
  [+] Adds test for None email case
       -> New test_register_null_email test added in tests/test_auth.py
```

### Python API

```python
from drift_guard import verify

report = verify(
    pr_title="Refactor payment processor to use new Stripe SDK",
    pr_description="""
    - Updates stripe.charge() calls to stripe.PaymentIntent.create()
    - Removes deprecated customer.sources usage
    - Does not change the public API of charge_customer()
    """,
    base="origin/main",
    head="HEAD",
)

if not report.passed():
    print(report.to_markdown())
    exit(1)

print(f"Drift score: {report.drift_score:.2f}")
print(f"Confidence: {report.overall_confidence:.0%}")
```

### GitHub Action

```yaml
# .github/workflows/drift-guard.yml
name: drift-guard

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  verify-intent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install drift-guard
        run: pip install drift-guard

      - name: Verify PR intent
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          drift-guard verify \
            --title "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}" \
            --description "${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}" \
            --base origin/${{ github.base_ref }} \
            --head ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} \
            --format markdown \
            --threshold 0.3
```

## How It Works

**Three-layer verification:**

```
PR title + description
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Intent Parser  │  Extracts structured clauses from natural language:
│                 │  "adds X", "removes Y", "ensures Z", "does not..."
└────────┬────────┘
         │ clauses
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Diff Fetcher   │  git diff base..head → structured DiffHunks
│  + Parser       │  File paths, added/removed lines, hunk boundaries
└────────┬────────┘
         │ diff
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  LLM Verifier   │  Claude (claude-3-5-haiku by default) checks each
│  (Claude)       │  clause against the actual diff. Returns:
│                 │  - PASS / FAIL / WARN / SKIP per clause
│                 │  - Evidence quote from the diff
│                 │  - Drift score (0.0–1.0)
└────────┬────────┘
         │ report
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  SQLite Trace   │  Every report persisted. Drift trends visible.
│  Log            │  history subcommand shows all PRs over time.
└─────────────────┘
```

**Drift Score:**
- `0.00` — All clauses fulfilled. PR does exactly what it says.
- `0.30` — Default threshold. Above this, CI gate fails.
- `1.00` — Complete mismatch. PR says one thing; code does another.

## What drift-guard Catches

| Scenario | What happens | drift-guard verdict |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| PR says "fix null check", also silently removes auth guard | Tests pass | FAIL — auth removal not mentioned |
| PR says "add feature X", only adds skeleton | Tests pass | WARN — partial implementation |
| PR says "does not change public API", but renames a method | CI passes | FAIL — API change not in description |
| PR says "removes deprecated Y", only comments it out | Tests pass | WARN — removal incomplete |
| PR says "fix bug in payment flow", diff only touches logging | Tests pass | FAIL — no payment code changed |
| PR says "add validation for email", adds it correctly | Tests pass | PASS |

---

## Configuration

### `.drift-guard.toml` (project root)

```toml
[drift-guard]
threshold = 0.25          # Drift score above which CI fails (default: 0.30)
model = "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"   # LLM used for verification
warn_on_scope_creep = true            # Warn when diff exceeds stated scope
skip_on_no_description = true         # Skip verification if PR has no body
db_path = ".drift-guard.db"           # SQLite trace log location

[drift-guard.ignore_files]
# Files to exclude from scope-creep analysis
patterns = ["*.lock", "*.generated.*", "CHANGELOG.md"]
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required. Your Anthropic API key. |
| `DRIFT_GUARD_MODEL` | Override default model. |
| `DRIFT_GUARD_THRESHOLD` | Override default drift threshold. |
| `DRIFT_GUARD_DB` | Override SQLite database path. |

# Show verification history
drift-guard history --n 20

# Output formats
drift-guard verify ... --format text      # Human-readable (default)
drift-guard verify ... --format json      # Machine-readable JSON

## Comparison with Existing Tools

| Tool | What it does | Does it check intent? |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| CodeRabbit | Reviews code style, bugs, best practices | No |
| PR-Agent | Suggests improvements, summarizes diff | No |
| DeepEval | Evaluates LLM outputs against metrics | No |
| ESLint / Ruff | Lints syntax | No |
| Codecov | Measures test coverage | No |
| **drift-guard** | **Verifies code changes fulfill PR intent** | **Yes** |

drift-guard is not a replacement for any of these. It fills the gap they all leave: the semantic gap between what a PR claims to do and what the code actually does.

## Why This Matters in 2026

"A change like 'add a required field to a shared request schema' looked 'small' in the PR, but silently broke dozens of downstream services and jobs." — Salesforce Engineering Blog, 2025

With 42% of code now AI-generated:
- PRs move faster than human reviewers can track
- AI code often passes tests while violating unstated assumptions
- Silent scope creep in AI-assisted PRs has increased 38% YoY
- Intent drift is the #1 source of "this should have been caught in review" incidents

drift-guard gives every team a systematic, automated check that every PR's code matches its stated intent — before merge.

---

## Biblical Foundation

> "I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law." — Romans 7:7

The law in Romans 7 does not fix behavior — it makes violations *visible*. Before the law, sin was undetected. The law creates the measurement standard that exposes the gap between reality and requirement.

drift-guard operates on the same principle: without an explicit intent contract, code drift is invisible. The PR description becomes the law. The diff is measured against it. Violations that were previously invisible — passing tests, passing review — become detectable.

Romans 8 adds the resolution: the Spirit fulfills what the law could only reveal. In software terms: drift-guard doesn't write better PRs. It makes the gap so visible that engineers are forced to either write better descriptions or fix the code. The law creates the pressure that produces quality.

This is the **Romans Verification Pattern** — Law exposes; measurement enables; quality follows.
